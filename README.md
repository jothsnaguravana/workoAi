To view clone the project and use "npm install" command to install all dependencies in the project. 
It is a basic user data view and update project built over technologies like nodejs(express) , mongodb , and other dependencies to enable security and data manipulation. 

Once all the dependencies are installed , run the program using "npm start" command. 

You can test the program api methods using postman or any other testing software online. The routes that need to be tested are given in the routes folder . You can simply copy the url with the respective rest api method and view the output. 

You also need to change the mongodb url with your respective url which work with nodejs for premanent data storage view. For that you can simply login to mongodb.com and create a project. In that , you can create a cluster with your own needs and deploy it. 
You will finally recieve some cdn links (For Eg : mongodb+nodejs , +java , + other third party tools etc) . You can choose nodejs link and copy and paste it in app.js folder where you need to provide the connecting link. 
Now you can simply run the tests on it.
